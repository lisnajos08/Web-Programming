<h3><b>Visual Object Tracking</b></h3>

<body bgcolor="pink">

<p style="font-family:courier;">Visual object tracking is a crucil problem in computer vision.</p>

<p style="font-family:verdana;">It has a wide range of applications in elds such as human-computer interaction,behavior recognition,robotics,and surveillance.</p>

<p style="font-family:arial black">Visual object tracking estimates the target position in each frame of the image sequence,given the initial state of the target in the previous frame.</p>

<p style="font-family:bell mt;">Lucas and Kanade proposed that the tracking of the moving target can be realized using the pixel relationship between adjacent frames of the video sequence and displacement changes of the pixels.</p>

<p style="font-family:times new roman">However,this algorithm can only detect the medium-sized target that shifts between two frames.</p>

<p style="font-family:vladimir script",>With the recent advances of the correlation Iter in computer vision  Bolme proposed the Minimum Output Sum of Squared Error(MOSSE) Iter,which can produce stable correlation Iters to track the object.</p>

<p style="font-family:gigi;">.Althoug the MOSSE's computational eficiency is high,its algorithm precision is low,and it can only process the gray information of a single channel.</p>
